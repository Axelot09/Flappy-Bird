# Flappy-Bird

This project is a Python implementation of the popular Flappy Bird game, developed using the Pygame library. In this game, the player controls a bird that must navigate through gaps between moving pipes by pressing the spacebar to make the bird flap its wings. The bird is subject to gravity, requiring precise timing to keep it airborne and avoid obstacles. The pipes move from right to left. The project involves creating a Bird class to manage the bird’s movement and a Pipe class to handle the generation, movement, and collision detection of the pipes. The game loop continuously updates the bird’s position, handles user input, checks for collisions, and renders the game objects on the screen.
